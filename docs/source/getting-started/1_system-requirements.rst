System Requirements
===================

The documentation has been tested using the `Ubuntu OS <https://ubuntu.com/>`_ on a rented virtual private server (for Thingsboard) as well as using the `Raspberry Pi OS <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_ on a Raspberry Pi device (for the edge gateway).

However, both Thingsboard and the edge gateway software can be installed on any Linux based system that supports Docker. Notes specific to setting up the edge gateway on a Raspberry Pi are included.

Minimum system requirements are:
